Think OS Chapter 2  
Reading Questions

**1) Give a real-world example of virtualization (ideally not one of the ones in the book).**

A real world example of virtualization is ordering something off of Amazon.com. I see something I want online. I go to checkout and I pay for it. The thing I want is in some warehouse somewhere and an incredibly complicated process begins to get it to me but all I see is my order in progress.

**2) What is the difference between a program and a process?**

A process is a software object that wraps a program. An attribute of a process is the program code and another attribute is the data associated with the program. A program may run on several processes with different data and hardware states.

**3) What is the primary purpose of the process abstraction?  What illusion does the process abstraction create?**

The primary purpose of the process abstraction is isolation which lets programmers not have to think about every possible interaction for running programs. Isolation lets programmers not have to worry about multitasking, virtual memory, or sharing hardware.

**4) What is the kernel?**

The kernel is the part of the operating system responsible for core capabilities like creating threads.

**5) What is a daemon?**

A daemon is a process that runs in the background and provides operating system services.
