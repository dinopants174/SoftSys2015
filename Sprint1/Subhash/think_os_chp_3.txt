1) You need 6 because 32 (2^5) is not enough.

2) 4294967296 characters

3) Memory is RAM (Random Access Memory) where values and variables that change and are manipulated are stored, and Storage will refer to HDD and SSD where data and files are stored long-term.

4) GiB is Gibibyte, which is 2^30 bytes (binary), and GB is a gigabyte, which is 10^9 (decimal). A gigabyte is 93% the size of a gibibyte.

5) It makes it so that processes are never looking at the actual physical addresses where memory is located, and only deal with "virtual address" that it is given to deal with. In this way, you know that the processes are not overlapping in memory, isolating them effectively.

6) Because the stack grows down and the heap grows up, it makes sense to put them at opposite ends, so as to minimize the risk of conflict between the two.

7) I'm guessing a dictionary, and I think that because whenever you create a key-value pair it is storing it in a certain place for memory based on a hashtable, and I'm not sure if that has anything at all to do with the page tables.

8) It's what allows the operating system to pause or stop a running program on one process, save its state, and then start up or continue another process.

9) I got:

Address of main is 		0x        40057d
Address of global is 	0x        60104c
Address of local is 	0x  7ffd5a7425c4
Address of p is 		0x        f67010

a) 

Address of p is 0x2053010
Address of q is 0x20530a0

Looking at the digits second from the right (a and 1), a - 1 is 8, and 16^1 = 16, so there is a difference of 16*8 (or 128), which makes sense because *q = malloc(128).

b)

Address of local is 0x7fff8cab535c
Address of funk is 0x7fff8cab533c

It moved down, as expected, because stack grows down.

c)

I chose the number 5. my address numbers were:

Address of x is 0xd08130
Address of y is 0xd08150

subtracting them yielded: 0x20, which is 32. I'm guessing this means that the memory allocation happens in bins of 32? Test with number 15 yields the same result. Testing with 33 yields a difference of 48. Perhaps then it is in chunks of 16?
