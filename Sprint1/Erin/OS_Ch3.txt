1) Six bits are needed to specify a letter.
2) 2^32=4,294,967,296 characters.
3) Memory is volitile (it clears when the machine is powered off).  Storage persists even if the computer is powered off.
4) A GiB is 2^30 bytes, and a GB is 10^9 bytes. A GB is only very slightly larger than a GiB (1.07 times to be exact).
5) The memory manager takes virtual adresses and converts them to unique real addresses, which keeps processes from reading eachothers stuff, even if they have the same virtual address.
6) So one can grow into the other ones space if one is big and one is small.  If they cross you will have a bad time.
7) Herm.  Python.
8) Contex switching is when the OS decides to halt one process and run another.

1&2)
// Address of main is   0x   106f1de10
// Address of global is 0x   106f1e020
// Address of local is  0x7fff58ce2b98
// Address of local2 is 0x7fff58ce2b94
// Address of p is      0x7fdc63c04a30
// Address of q is      0x7fdc63c04ab0

The stack grows down, the heap grows up

3)
// Address of p is 0x7f8daac04a30
// Address of q is 0x7f8daac04a50
So they are 32 bits apart
